# happyfresh-product-scrap
scrap happyfresh product name and price

To scrap from Happyfresh website with target as :
- product name
- product price
- product pack quantity
- product price per quantity

#Required : Selenium & Chrome webdriver

#Pros : - can acquire multi and specific category and outlet
#Cons : - To bypass unidentified char in product name, i am using encode to utf-8 which result needing additional processing
        - Price need additional processing
        - Some product will have different name across another outlet
        

This code need lot of improvement tho😅🙏
